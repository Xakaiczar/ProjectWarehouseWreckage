# Project "Warehouse Wreckage"
_Developed with Unreal Engine 5_

**DISCLAIMER**: This project is based heavily on "Warehouse Wreckage", the first module of "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games" by GamedevTV. Most of the code will have been written and designed by me, and it may differ significantly as I diverge from the lecturer to solve the problem myself. However, all work here is inspired by - and heavily derivative of - work that is not my own, therefore this project is not my own and cannot be distributed. This project is for assessment by prospective employers only.

# About the Project
"Warehouse Wreckage" is the name of the first module in the course "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games" by GamedevTV. The premise is simple: knock over every object in the room with a limited supply of ammunition. However, the course does not implement any successful end condition; the player can only lose. I added a win condition myself, properly telegraphed that information to the player, and - to challenge myself - I did it all using Blueprints.

The project is complete (for now...), but this section still needs to be completed. Check back soon for screenshots and a little insight into my process!
